# Introduction
This is __database.dart__, a vendor-agnostic database API for [Flutter](https://flutter.io) and
other [Dart](https://dart.dev) projects.

## Features
  * ğŸ‘« __Document & SQL database support__. The API has been designed to support both SQL databases
    and document databases. You - or your customers - can always choose the best database without
    rewriting any code.
  * ğŸ”­ __Full-text search engine support__. The API supports forwarding specific queries to search
    engines that can, for example, handle natural language queries better than transaction databases.
    There are already several search engines already supported (Algolia, ElasticSearch, and a simple
    search engine written in Dart).
  * ğŸšš __Used in commercial products__. The authors use the package in enterprise applications. The
    package is also used by open-source projects such as [Dint](https://dint.dev).
